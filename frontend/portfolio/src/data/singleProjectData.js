The program allows for reading an automaton from a file, storing it in memory, and displaying it on the screen. One of the key functionalities is to test the presence of epsilon transitions in the automaton, indicating an asynchronous automaton. If the automaton is not a complete deterministic one, the program can generate an equivalent complete deterministic automaton."

					"The Sportvision project emerged from a desire to empower athletes and coaches seeking performance improvement and injury risk reduction. The primary objective was to create a tool that analyzes sports videos, detects incorrect movements, and provides users with constructive feedback. The motivation behind Sportvision was to address the challenge faced by beginners sports player who struggle to identify and correct subtle flaws in execution, hindering skill improvement and increasing the risk of injury.",

					"In line with agile project management principles, we adopted the Scrum methodology, with my role as Scrum Master facilitating efficient collaboration and progress tracking. The development process involved creating a seamless user experience, allowing individuals to capture videos of their performances. These videos were securely stored on AWS S3, enabling users to track their historical data. Leveraging an AWS-hosted Flask API and the OpenPose model, we extracted temporal three-dimensional coordinates from the videos. The MotionBert model was then employed to generate a 3D avatar showcasing the subject's movements. Finally, we employed a machine learning model trained on the THETIS dataset to classify the service as either good or in need of improvement.",

By extracting features like n-grams and metadata from the text, the search engine creates a robust index that enables precise matching with user queries. This advanced functionality not only streamlines the search process but also improves the overall user experience by providing tailored and accurate search results."
